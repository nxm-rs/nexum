## What is Nexum?

Nexum is a high-performance Ethereum provider written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly, built for both web extensions and terminal interfaces. Forked from [frame-extension](https://github.com/frame-labs/frame-extension), Nexum is a `EIP-1193`-compliant provider that offers secure and hacker-friendly access to Ethereum.

Nexum combines **WebTransport** with a **terminal-based** interface, ideal for developers seeking a flexible, performant tool to interact with Ethereum across web and terminal environments.

## Goals 🥅

1. **Compliance**: Full [`EIP-1193`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1193) and [`EIP-6963`](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6963) compliance.
2. **Performance**: Rust and WASM for optimal speed and secure memory management.
3. **Web & Terminal Integration**: Uses [WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport) for a seamless connection across environments.
4. **Hackable**: Developer-first Ethereum access, suitable for dApps, testing, and experiments.

## Status 📍

Nexum is in **active development**. Documentation, user guides, and installation instructions are in progress. Follow along and contribute as we grow Nexum into a powerful tool for web and terminal-based Ethereum interaction!
